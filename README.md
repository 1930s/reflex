## Reflex
### Practical Functional Reactive Programming

Reflex is an fully-deterministic, higher-order Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) interface and an engine that efficiently implements that interface.

[Reflex-DOM](https://github.com/ryantrinkle/reflex-dom) is a framework built on Reflex that facilitates the development of web pages, including highly-interactive single-page apps.

Documentation is still a work in progress, but a tutorial for Reflex and Reflex-DOM is available at https://github.com/ryantrinkle/try-reflex and an introductory talk given at the New York Haskell Meetup is available here: [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvkcskJbc4) / [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qfc9XFVo2c).
